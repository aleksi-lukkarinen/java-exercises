# java-exercises

Old small programming exercises in Java.


## Development

The repository contains a development container specification for VisualStudio Code. Please open the root folder in VS Code and, if necessary, ask VS Code to reopen itself for development in the container. Then the individual Java programs can be easily run and debugged from the IDE. When the configuration is correct, the title of the VS Code application window should contain something like `java-exercises [Dev Container: Java 8]`.
